= Luncher

This application is meant to help with ordering lunches in companies and workgroups.

== What does Luncher provide?

1. User registration (password recovery not implemented yet).
2. Admin account to manage lunch options, user balances, and order lists.
3. Refundable lunches (e.g. partially covered by company).

== What's still missing?

1. Proper functional/integration tests.
2. Password recovery (the code is there, but not tested and no interface is provided).
3. Automatic system locking at the time specified in configuration.
4. One-click e-mail notification sending (triggered by admin when the lunches arrive).
5. Lunch vendors interface (to define them and later select a vendor when adding lunches).
6. Configuration page:
    * amount of mouney refunded by company per lunch,
    * amount of refunded lunches per day,
    * time of system locking/unlocking,
     
7. FUN!!! Rating lunches, comments, suggestions, etc. :)
8. ...?

== Requirements

Authorization is based on AuthLogic (http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic), and administrator privileges are implemented using Lockdown (http://stonean.com/page/lockdown). Two gems are required:
