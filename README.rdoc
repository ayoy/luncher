= Luncher

This application is meant to help with ordering lunches in companies and workgroups.

== What does Luncher provide?

1. User registration (together with password recovery).
2. Admin account to manage lunch options, user balances, and order lists.
3. Refundable lunches (e.g. partially covered by company).

== What's still missing?

1. Proper functional/integration tests.
2. Automatic system locking at the time specified in configuration.
3. One-click e-mail notification sending (triggered by admin when the lunches arrive).
4. Lunch vendors interface (to define them and later select a vendor when adding lunches).
5. Configuration page:
    * amount of mouney refunded by company per lunch,
    * amount of refunded lunches per day,
    * time of system locking/unlocking,
     
6. FUN!!! Rating lunches, comments, suggestions, etc. :)
7. ...?
